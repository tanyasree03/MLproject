## ML project to understand the student's performance


### 1. **Engineered Machine Learning Model**  
   - Developed a robust machine learning model focused on accurately predicting student performance based on various factors such as test preparation, parental level of education, and prior test scores.
   - **Technologies Used**: Leveraged regression algorithms, including linear regression and others, to model student performance. Hyperparameter tuning techniques were applied to optimize the model for higher accuracy and generalization.

### 2. **Hyperparameter Tuning for Optimal Performance**  
   - Fine-tuned the model's hyperparameters, such as learning rate, regularization strength, and feature selection, to enhance prediction accuracy.
   - **Impact**: This process reduced overfitting/underfitting, resulting in a more reliable model that performs well on unseen data.

### 3. **Modular Coding and Pipelines**  
   - **Modular Design**: The project follows a modular coding approach, with separate components for data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and result visualization. This structure ensures the code is organized, easy to maintain, and scalable.
   - **Pipelines**: Automated the workflow using pipelines, which helped streamline data processing, training, and model evaluation, making the system efficient and scalable.

### 4. **User-friendly Web Interface (HTML, CSS, Flask)**  
   - Developed an interactive web interface using HTML, CSS, and Flask, allowing users to easily input independent variables like test preparation, parental education level, and other scores.
   - **User Experience**: The interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, providing real-time performance predictions based on the machine learning model, making the tool accessible to non-technical users.

### 5. **Data-driven Insights for Educational Success**  
   - By incorporating variables like test preparation, parental education, and other test scores, the project aims to offer valuable insights into student performance, helping identify areas for improvement.
